#  Email onbording and notifications

This wasnt a main feature I had in mind but since This is more of a closed off system I would like the Admins have more control over who is getting logged in and wo is getting onboared to the system 

# I DO NOT WANT RANDM PEOPLE JOINING THIS SYSTEM 

# Notifications
Since making the onboarding system i decided since that funconaity will be in place to also sends email notifications as well 

Admin and Operational managers- Will Get all notifications

IT will get asset manager and Ticket notifications

Staff wil ony get Ticket notifications 

agents and misc will get notification of there own ticket
